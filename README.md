OVERVIEW OF PROJECT:
Project Description: Hosting a Static Website Using Google Cloud Storage

This project focuses on creating and deploying a simple HTML/CSS static website using Google Cloud Storage. The goal is to design a basic website structure, styled with CSS, and publish it in a reliable, scalable cloud environment without requiring a server. Google Cloud Storage provides a cost-effective way to host static sites by serving HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other static assets directly to users.

Key Steps:
Website Design and Structure: Develop a simple, responsive website using HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and functional layout.

Setting Up Google Cloud Storage: Create a Google Cloud Storage bucket specifically configured for hosting static content. Ensure the bucket is publicly accessible to allow users to view the website.

Deploying the Website: Upload the HTML, CSS, and any additional assets (e.g., images) to the storage bucket. Set up the bucket to serve the index.html file as the default page.

Configuring Permissions and Access: Adjust bucket permissions to ensure files are publicly accessible. Set the appropriate caching and metadata settings for better site performance.

Testing and Optimization: Verify that the website is accessible via the provided Google Cloud Storage URL. Test the website on various devices to ensure responsiveness and optimize load times if needed.

This project offers hands-on experience with Google Cloud's services and provides a foundational understanding of static website hosting.
